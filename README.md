This app consist in a pkm team builder. You can basically search pkm's, view their info and make team of six pkm's.

## What it does?

- Search pkm's and view their info like name, dex number, stats, resistances and weaknesses.
- Make team's of six pkm's and give it a name.
- Import/Export teams with a basic code system, easy to use and very intuitive

## Future features

Right now, if you want to delete a team, it is only possible to delete the last team created (or imported) or all the teams. In the future the plan is incorporate a way that let you delete any selected team, and not just the las one.

Add a functionality where you can be assisted in a creation of a team, receaving recomendations of different pkm's based on your teams weaknesses.
